# Setting up the Slack app
1. Create an app
1. Go to OAuth & Permissions, create a User token, and give it these scopes: [search:read, reactions:read, channels:history]
1. Go to Incoming Webhooks and turn them on
1. Make and endpoint for each channel attendance will be taken in (and optionally, add those endpoints to attend.py)
